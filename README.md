# NewsCluster - Stay Updated

## Reason:
In this fast paced world one hardly gets enough time to stay updated with all sorts of happenings in the world and if one gets some time then he might have to surf multiple sites/channels to acquire true knowledge. But NewsCluster will help in  saving a lot of time and also eases the stuff which otherwise seems quite a work to do. Chrome extension will enable you to read the news while browsing. Mobile application will make it just more easier for the user to get news by just clicking few buttons.
